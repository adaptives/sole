1. Updated the schema of UserRegistratioDate to link to SocialUser instead of
   User. This will need the database schema to be updated. If we run the app
   with 
   'jpa.ddl=update'
   a second foreign key is created in the USERREGISTRATIONDATE table. This should
   be fine, but since we have very little data in the table, might as well drop
   the table, and then restart the app. This will ensure that the
   USERREGISTRATIONDATE table will have only one FK. We can import the data
   into the table again after restarting.
